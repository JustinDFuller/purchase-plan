# Purchase Plan

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/JustinDFuller/purchase-plan/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/JustinDFuller/purchase-plan)

An app that helps you plan and save for your purchases.

## What?

I want to buy a bunch of stuff that I don't have enough money for. Should I buy it on credit? No! I should save for it. 

Saving can be really hard, but with the right set of tools and motivations you can accomplish your goals. Purchase Saving Planner will help you save for and plan your purchases by calculating when you can make the purchase. It does this by storing the amount you currently have, tracking your rate of savings, then using this to calculate when you'll be able to purchase what you want.

To make things even easier, it will aim to give positive feedback when you patiently save for what you want, and for when you display other healthy habits, such as increasing your saving rate.

## How

First up, we'll need to know where you are starting. Are you starting your first bank account or do you just want to start using your established savings more effectively?

Next, you'll need to figure out how much you are saving each period. A period is how often you are paid. This could be once a month, every 2 weeks, weekly, or some other combination. It should also be aware that some people receive money randomly. 

Once you've established how much you have and how much you will be saving, you can begin entering your goals: what you want to buy.

You'll enter what you want to buy in one of two ways. Primarily, you can provide a link and the app will scrape that site to see what the item is and how much it costs. Alternatively, you can manually enter the information (in case it isn't from an online store). 

You should also be able to group multiple items into a single purchase (such as a set of patio furniture).

When it's time for you to be able to make a purchase the app will let you know!
